# Building for the Linux target

In this file, we explain how to build your code for the Linux target. 

We see two ways to build 
- CLI ( Command Line Interface )
- VS Code ( Visual Studio Code )

## Configuration and building on CLI

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ 
cmake --build build --target all
```

## Configuration and building on VS Code

To configure the project on VS Code, click the CMake tool extension, and then click the "Select a Kit" button in the "Configure" group.

In the pull down menu, select the "GCC XX.YY.Z x86_64-linux-gnu". Then, VS Code will start the CMake configuration.

```

## How to run the application from VS Code
From the VS Code, click the run (â–·) button to run the program.
